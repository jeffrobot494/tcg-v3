> How tall is a typical Mars Dominion soldier?

● A typical Mars Dominion soldier stands between 6'6" (198cm) and 7'2" (218cm) tall - significantly taller than baseline humans.

  This enhanced height results from deliberate genetic engineering focused on several advantages:
  - Increased leverage and reach in Mars' lower gravity environment
  - Greater muscle mass capacity for enhanced strength
  - Improved cardiovascular efficiency through elongated torso
  - Better heat dissipation through increased surface area

  Specialized units may vary from this standard:
  - Heavy Assault Troopers often reach 7'5" (226cm) or taller
  - Scout/Reconnaissance units might be somewhat shorter at 6'4" (193cm) for improved agility
  - Variable-G Commandos have slightly more compact frames for multi-gravity operations

  The increased height is accompanied by proportional bone density enhancements and reinforced joint structures to maintain functionality across different gravitational environments. This distinctive physical profile makes
  Mars Dominion soldiers immediately recognizable throughout the Solar System.

  counterparts, Mars civilians nonetheless live in a world where their bodies and minds are engineered products, their social roles largely predetermined by genetic specialization, and their cultural identity built around
  evolutionary superiority. The result is a highly efficient, purpose-built society with remarkable capabilities, but one where individual freedom is subordinated to collective evolutionary progress.

> Is the Dominion working towards the full terraforming of Mars, so that Martians can live unobstructed on the surface? And if so, how is that progressing? Make this interesting for story complications.

  - Transition Species Concept: Acceptance that current Martians may be unsustainable transition stage
  - Earth's Shadow: Dawning realization that humanity may be permanently bound to its homeworld

  The Mars Dominion faces the ultimate irony: in their rush to transcend humanity's evolutionary past, they've discovered its inescapable power. The human body carries the accumulated wisdom of millions of years of Earth
  evolution - a deep code that resists hasty revision. What the Dominion portrayed as triumph increasingly appears to be tragedy - a population of superhumans who may represent not humanity's future but an evolutionary dead
  end, magnificent but fundamentally unviable without their ancestral home.

  This creates profound narrative tension: a society built on the ideology of genetic superiority facing evidence of its fundamental unsustainability; a military superpower whose enhanced soldiers excel in combat but struggle
   to survive; a culture celebrating its independence from Earth while secretly acknowledging they may never truly escape its influence. The Mars Dominion must now confront whether their path of adaptation represents
  evolution or extinction - and what desperate measures they might take to ensure their survival.
