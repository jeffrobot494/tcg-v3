Viktor Abendroth: The Lazarite Paragon
Viktor Abendroth represents the pinnacle of the Mars Dominion's genetic engineering program. Born in the highly classified "Lazaritkorps" experimental facility deep beneath Olympus Mons in 2027, Viktor was the first and only successful integration of Lazarite material with human genetics.
Unlike other Mars Dominion enhancement programs, the Lazaritkorps initiative focused on quantum-biological interfaces rather than conventional physical enhancements. The program's goal was to create soldiers who could manipulate the fundamental forces that Lazarite interacts with.
Background
Viktor began as a typical Mars Dominion military subject - already genetically enhanced with the standard military package. What made him unique was his rare genetic marker that showed compatibility with Lazarite integration. When conventional subjects exposed to Lazarite suffered catastrophic cellular breakdown, Viktor's cells formed a stable bond with the exotic material.
His integration was not without cost. The process was excruciating, and he experienced periods of quantum disassociation where parts of his consciousness existed across multiple probability states simultaneously. Military psychologists noted he sometimes responded to questions before they were asked, or referenced events that hadn't occurred.
Abilities
Viktor's most remarkable ability is what Mars Dominion scientists call "genetic resonance" - he can temporarily imprint his genetic superiority onto other enhanced soldiers, elevating their capabilities beyond designed parameters. This makes him extraordinarily valuable as a field commander, as he doesn't just give orders but biologically optimizes his troops for specific combat scenarios.
His secondary ability involves limited quantum displacement - he can briefly phase out of conventional reality, making him nearly impossible to target with conventional weapons. This ability is unstable and taxing on his physiology, so it can only be used sparingly.
Current Status
Viktor serves as the field commander for the elite Lazaritkorps, a small but extraordinarily powerful unit consisting of the handful of other (less successful) Lazarite-integrated soldiers. He is kept under constant medical supervision, as his unique physiology presents ongoing stabilization challenges.
The Mars Dominion High Command views him as both their greatest achievement and a potential liability - his enhanced perception sometimes leads him to question strategic decisions or propose unconventional tactics that contradict established doctrine.
Reichsprotektor Reiser personally oversees the Lazaritkorps program and maintains a direct command link to Viktor, bypassing normal chain of command. This special attention has created some resentment among traditional military leadership, who view the Lazaritkorps as consuming disproportionate resources for their limited numbers.

Specialist Erich Voss - "The Pressure Walker"
Background:
Born in the deep habitat levels of Valles Marineris, Erich was selected for vacuum adaptation at age 6 after showing remarkable lung capacity and unusually efficient oxygen utilization. His modifications went further than standard, with experimental dermal reinforcement that allows him to withstand dramatic pressure changes.
Genetic Modifications:
Voss's skin contains a lattice of carbon nanofibers that prevent explosive decompression, while specialized hemoglobin modifications allow his blood to retain oxygen efficiency even in near-vacuum conditions. His eyes have pressurized chambers to prevent rupturing, and his joints contain specialized fluid reservoirs that maintain function without atmospheric pressure.
Combat Role:
Voss specializes in rapid deployment from space to planetary surface without transition equipment. He can survive hull breaches that would kill his squadmates, and often serves as the advance scout for boarding operations, moving through vacuum without a suit to bypass enemy security systems.
Personal Story:
After losing his squad during a Silicon Ascendancy ambash in the asteroid belt, Voss survived by venting himself into space rather than being captured. He drifted for 72 hours before being recovered, setting a new survival record for vacuum exposure. The experience left him with a pathological hatred of AI systems and a tendency to operate alone.


Lieutenant Aria Steinhauer - "The Gravity Dancer"
Background:
Third-generation Martian from Olympus Mons Military Academy, Aria represents the pinnacle of gravitational adaptation. Her movements in Mars' gravity have an uncanny fluid quality that makes her appear to be dancing rather than walking or running.
Genetic Modifications:
Aria's inner ear contains an artificial gravity sensing organ that provides precise awareness of local gravitational conditions. Her muscle fibers have been modified for explosive power in low gravity, with specialized neural controls that prevent over-extension. Her spine contains a series of fluid chambers that automatically adjust her center of balance as gravitational conditions change.
Combat Role:
Aria leads the elite "Gravity Manipulation Team," a special forces unit that exploits gravitational differences to devastating effect. They often deploy to environments with variable or unpredictable gravity—asteroid bases, damaged habitats, or the edges of BLACKLIGHT fields—where their adaptations give them an overwhelming advantage.
Personal Story:
Aria lost her twin sister during the third phase of enhancement procedures—her body adapted perfectly while her sister's rejected the modifications. This created both a fanatical belief in genetic superiority and a hidden fear that her own modifications might ultimately fail. She drives herself and her team to increasingly dangerous missions, as if testing the limits of their enhancements.

Major Dietrich Kohl - "The Red Colossus"
Background:
At 7'4" tall with proportional mass, Kohl is among the largest Mars Dominion soldiers ever produced. A fourth-generation subject of the Heavy Assault program, his immense size is combined with surprising speed due to Mars' lower gravity.
Genetic Modifications:
Kohl's skeleton contains an artificial lattice of metallic compounds that increase his bone density by 300%. His muscle fibers are triple-layered, providing strength that would be impossible on Earth without mechanical assistance. His heart is nearly twice normal size, with additional chambers to efficiently pump blood through his massive frame even under exertion.
Combat Role:
Kohl serves as both heavy weapons platform and shock trooper. In boarding actions, he typically breaches bulkheads manually, tearing through metal barriers that would require specialized equipment for standard troops. In ground combat, he can carry weapon systems normally mounted on vehicles.
Personal Story:
Despite his intimidating presence, Kohl suffers from "Structural Overgrowth Disorder," a side effect of his extreme modifications. His bones continue to grow slowly but steadily, requiring painful monthly treatments to prevent joint dysfunction. Mars Dominion propaganda presents him as the future of human evolution, but medical specialists privately estimate he has less than ten years before his enhancements become unsustainable.

Captain Helena Weber - "The Sensor"
Background:
Helena represents an entirely different direction in Mars Dominion enhancement—instead of focusing on strength or environmental adaptation, her modifications targeted sensory capabilities. She can perceive wavelengths of light invisible to standard humans, detect minute changes in air composition, and hear sounds well beyond normal human range.
Genetic Modifications:
Helena's eyes contain additional cone types allowing her to see into both ultraviolet and infrared ranges. Her olfactory system has been expanded with structures inspired by canine genetics, while her auditory system includes resonant chambers that amplify specific frequency ranges. Most remarkably, she possesses an artificial electromagnetic sense based on shark biology, allowing her to detect power systems and communications equipment at range.
Combat Role:
Helena leads reconnaissance and intelligence operations, often deployed ahead of standard forces to analyze enemy positions, detect ambushes, and identify weaknesses in defensive systems. She can identify specific individuals by scent alone, detect the type of weapon by its electromagnetic signature, and see camouflaged or hidden positions that would be invisible to others.
Personal Story:
Helena's extreme sensory enhancements come with psychological costs. She requires significant medication to prevent sensory overload, and experiences the world in ways other humans—even enhanced ones—cannot understand. This creates a profound isolation, made worse by her ability to literally sense the discomfort her presence causes in others. She has developed a detached, almost clinical view of combat, treating it as a puzzle of sensory data rather than a human conflict.

Sergeant Klaus Eisenberg - "The Thermomorph"
Background:
Designed specifically for operations on Mercury and other extreme thermal environments, Klaus represents the Mars Dominion's adaptation to the full range of Solar System conditions.
Genetic Modifications:
Klaus's skin contains a layer of specialized cells that can rapidly expand or contract, changing his body's thermal properties. His blood contains molecular structures that prevent freezing at temperatures as low as -50°C, while his sweat glands can produce a crystalline substance that reflects radiation. Most impressively, his internal organs are surrounded by a bioengineered thermal gel that insulates them from external temperature fluctuations.
Combat Role:
Klaus leads the "Temperature Specialist" unit that operates in environments too hot or cold for standard troops. They are particularly effective in Mercury operations, where temperature differentials between sunlight and shadow can exceed 300°C. His unit also specializes in sabotage operations against cooling systems in enemy habitats and vessels.
Personal Story:
Klaus's thermal adaptations have disconnected him from normal human experiences of comfort. He cannot feel "warm" or "cold" in the way others do, experiencing temperature only as data rather than sensation. This extends metaphorically to his personality—he approaches all situations with the same measured calculation, showing neither excitement nor fear. Fellow soldiers find him unsettling to be around, claiming that standing near him feels like being next to "something not quite human."

Dr. Ingrid Hauser - "The Living Laboratory"
Background:
Unlike most Mars Dominion enhanced soldiers, Ingrid began as a geneticist before volunteering for experimental procedures on herself. She represents a unique case where the scientist became the subject, allowing her to provide unprecedented insights into the enhancement process.
Genetic Modifications:
Ingrid has undergone over 40 separate enhancement procedures, many of her own design. Her body contains experimental gene regulatory systems that allow her to consciously control certain aspects of her physiology—including blood flow, immune response, and even some aspects of cellular repair. She can temporarily enhance certain capabilities at the cost of others, effectively "reconfiguring" herself for specific missions.
Role:
Ingrid serves a dual role as both combat scientist and experimental subject. She accompanies high-risk missions to observe enhancement performance in the field, while also participating directly to test her own modifications. Data collected from her missions has driven significant improvements in the enhancement program, particularly regarding adaptation to unexpected conditions.
Personal Story:
Ingrid's willingness to experiment on herself stems from a profound belief in the Mars Dominion's evolutionary ideology—but also from personal tragedy. Her husband died from Generational Degradation Syndrome, one of the hidden costs of the enhancement program. She is driven to solve these issues before they become widespread, working against time as her own modifications show early signs of the same syndrome.

Private First Class Otto Krause - "The Throwback"
Background:
Otto represents something increasingly rare in the Mars Dominion military—a first-generation enhanced soldier. Born on Earth and enhanced as an adult, his modifications are less extreme than later generations, making him a living example of how quickly the program has advanced.
Genetic Modifications:
Otto's enhancements focus on practical combat advantages rather than environmental adaptation: increased muscle density, reinforced bone structure, accelerated reflexes, and enhanced vision. Compared to third and fourth-generation soldiers, his modifications appear almost crude—effective but without the specialization or integration of newer models.
Combat Role:
Despite being considered obsolete by modern Mars Dominion standards, Otto's experience and adaptability make him valuable as a training officer. He works with newly enhanced troops, helping them understand their capabilities while teaching combat techniques that exploit their advantages. His perspective as someone who remembers being unenhanced provides insights that born-enhanced soldiers lack.
Personal Story:
Otto represents a dying breed within the Mars Dominion—those who remember Earth as home rather than an abstract origin point. He secretly maintains a collection of Earth items: a vial of ocean water, pressed flowers, photographs of blue skies. As he watches each new generation become more adapted to Mars and less recognizably "human" by his standards, he questions whether the Dominion's path truly represents evolution or something else entirely. His loyalty remains absolute, but his perspective is increasingly unique and valuable.

Specialist Twins Marta and Magnus Roth - "The Resonance Pair"
Background:
The Roth twins represent one of the Mars Dominion's most unusual enhancement paths—genetic modifications designed to create synergistic capabilities between multiple subjects. Though separately they demonstrate only moderate enhancements, when operating within close proximity, their capabilities increase dramatically.
Genetic Modifications:
The twins share artificially designed brain structures that create a limited form of neural synchronization. Their sensory inputs partially merge when they are within 100 meters of each other, creating a composite awareness of their environment. Their cardiovascular systems contain specialized cells that emit and detect ultrasonic signals, allowing unconscious coordination of movement and even shared regulation of biological functions.
Combat Role:
The Roths operate as a two-person special operations team, exploiting their unique coordination for infiltration and assassination missions. Their ability to perceive through each other's senses makes them nearly impossible to ambush, while their synchronized movements appear almost choreographed. They can communicate silently and coordinate complex actions without visible signals.
Personal Story:
The physical connection between the twins creates profound psychological effects. They experience a partial merging of identity when in proximity, sometimes unable to distinguish which memories belong to which twin. This creates both an unbreakable bond and a desperate fear of separation. Mars Dominion psychologists debate whether they represent a successful evolution toward collective consciousness or a dangerous mutation that threatens individual identity—the core of human experience.

Commander Friedrich Weller - "The Pure Strain"
Background:
Friedrich represents the Mars Dominion's attempt to create the "perfect" enhanced human without specialization. Rather than extreme adaptations for specific environments or roles, his enhancements focus on balanced improvement across all attributes—a theoretical "pure strain" of enhanced humanity that could serve as a template for future generations.
Genetic Modifications:
Friedrich's enhancements are comprehensive but moderate—30% increases across all physical parameters rather than the 200-300% increases in specialized troops. His senses, strength, speed, and resilience are all significantly beyond baseline human capability, but without the extreme specialization that limits versatility. Most importantly, his modifications were designed for perfect stability and reproduction, avoiding the deterioration that plagues many enhanced soldiers.
Combat Role:
Friedrich leads the "Evolutionary Vanguard," an elite unit composed of similarly balanced enhanced soldiers. They serve as adaptable rapid-response forces, capable of operating effectively across a wide range of environments and mission types. Their lack of extreme specialization is compensated by superior tactical flexibility and coordination.
Personal Story:
Friedrich bears the immense psychological pressure of being the Mars Dominion's "perfect specimen." His genetic material is regularly harvested for the next generation of enhancements, and his performance is constantly monitored for signs of degradation or weakness. He has internalized this role completely, viewing himself not as an individual but as the physical embodiment of humanity's evolutionary future. This detachment gives him remarkable emotional stability in combat but creates a profound emptiness in his personal life—he exists as a template, not a person.
