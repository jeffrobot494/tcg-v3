What Makes a Good Card
Clear Purpose
A good card has a distinct role in the game. It should be immediately apparent what the card is designed to do - whether it's a straightforward combat unit, a utility piece, or a specialized combo enabler. Players should understand its purpose after reading it.
Strategic Depth
Good cards offer meaningful decisions. They might:

Present interesting tradeoffs (power vs. cost)
Offer tactical flexibility (multiple ways to use it)
Create strategic considerations (when to play it, what to combine it with)
Force priority decisions (what to target, when to commit resources)

Faction Identity
Cards should reflect their faction's themes, strengths, and weaknesses. For Mars Dominion, this means genetic enhancement, environmental adaptation, and physical superiority. The card should feel like it belongs in its faction through mechanics and flavor.
Varied Power Levels
Not every card needs to be a game-changer:

Workhorses: Reliable, consistent performers that form the backbone of strategies
Utility Cards: Provide specific functions that address particular situations
Specialists: Excel in specific circumstances but may be less useful elsewhere
Bombs: High-impact cards that can swing the game but come with appropriate costs

Balanced Cost-to-Effect Ratio
A card's cost should reflect its power level, but "good" doesn't always mean "efficient":

Some cards are deliberately inefficient but offer unique effects
Others are extremely efficient but narrow in application
The most flexible cards often demand a premium in cost

Synergy Potential
Good cards become better in combination with others. They might:

Benefit from specific support pieces
Enable other cards to perform better
Form part of an intentional strategic arc

Memorable Character
Cards should have personality through mechanics, art, and flavor text. They should be recognizable and create moments players remember, whether through dramatic game swings or consistent reliable performance.
Clear Text and Intuitive Design
Good cards have concise, unambiguous text that communicates exactly what they do without confusion. Complex effects should be worded as clearly as possible.
Different Types of Good Cards

Foundation Cards: Reliable, cost-effective units that provide consistent value
Utility Specialists: Solve specific problems or counter particular strategies
Force Multipliers: Enhance other cards rather than providing direct value
Tempo Plays: Create immediate board impact to shift momentum
Finishers: Close out games when conditions are right
Engines: Generate increasing advantage over time
Tech Cards: Narrow applications but extremely powerful in the right situation
Flexibility Tools: Provide options and adaptability

The best card designs don't try to do everything - they excel in their intended role while fitting into the broader game ecosystem. A card can be "good" by performing a simple function reliably, just as another card can be "good" by enabling dramatic, game-defining moments.
