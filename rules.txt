Rules Guide
OVERVIEW
In The Post-Human War, you control a faction fighting for dominance in the Sol System. Your goal is to grow your faction's population while eliminating your opponents through strategic expansion, resource management, and combat.
Players: 2-4 players Game Length: 30-60 minutes (estimated)
CORE CONCEPTS
Holdings
Holdings represent significant locations across the solar system (e.g., the Ares Industrial Complex on Mars). These are where your population lives and your base of operations.
Population is tracked using d6 dice on each holding
Each holding can "tap" for one or more essence types (Materia, Anima, Data)
Some holdings have Garrisons that provide automatic defense
Descendants
Descendants are your units that attack and defend. Each descendant has four attributes:
FORCE: Physical and kinetic strength (determines damage dealt)
PSYCHE: Mental strength and fortitude
VECTOR: Integration into networks and cyber warfare capability
SYNC: Overall synchronicity (determines attack order)
Many descendants also have special traits and abilities.
Essences
There are three types of essences used to pay for cards:
Materia: Physical matter (steel, gunpowder, etc.)
Anima: Will and determination
Data: Information that fuels AI and networks
GAME SETUP
(Game setup instructions can be added here based on additional information)
TURN SEQUENCE
On your turn, follow these steps in order:
Draw Phase: Draw one card from your deck
Explore Action: Select a new holding from the System Deck and add it to your empire
Populate Action: Choose ONE of the following:
Move population between your holdings
Increase a population by 1 on one of your holdings
Main Phase: Play cards by paying their essence costs
Deploy descendants to specific holdings
Play Works and other card types
Attack Phase: Declare attacks against opponents' holdings
End Phase: Refresh your holdings and Garrisons
PLAYING CARDS
Every card has an essence cost that must be paid to play it. Gain essences by tapping your holdings.
When you play a descendant, you must choose which of your holdings to deploy it to. This is crucial as descendants can only defend the holding where they are deployed.
COMBAT
When you declare an attack:
Declare which of your descendants are attacking and which opponent's holding they target
Your opponent declares which, if any, of their descendants will defend
If there are defenders, begin the Combat Phase:
Order all combatants by SYNC score (highest goes first)
In SYNC order, each combatant chooses a target to deal damage to equal to their FORCE
When a descendant takes FORCE damage, reduce their FORCE score by that amount
If a descendant's FORCE is reduced to 0, they are destroyed
Damaging Holdings
If all defending descendants are destroyed and attacking descendants still have attacks remaining, or if there is excess FORCE damage:
This damage is directed at the holding
Damage can be applied to either the population OR Works built on the holding
Garrisons
Some holdings have a Garrison with a specified FORCE value
Garrisons act as token descendants with SYNC 0 (always last to attack)
The holding's controller decides where the Garrison deals its damage
Garrisons must be destroyed before damage can be done to the holding
Garrisons replenish to full strength at the end of every turn
WINNING THE GAME
A player is eliminated when the population of all their holdings is reduced to zero
The last player remaining is the winner
